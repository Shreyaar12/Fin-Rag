1. Profitability analysis

How to complete a profitability analysis in five steps
Steps to Perform a Profitability Analysis
Gather Financial Statements:
Obtain the Profit and Loss (P&L) statements and Balance Sheets for your company and a competitor for the same period.
Calculate Key Profitability Ratios:
Gross Profit Margin: (Total Revenue - COGS) / Total Revenue
Operating Profit Margin: Operating Profit / Total Sales
Net Profit Margin: Net Income / Sales Revenue
Margin per User: (Total Revenue - Total Expenses) / Number of Users
Return on Assets: Net Income / Total Assets
Compare the Results:
Construct a comparative analysis to identify which company has better profitability metrics.
Analyze Differences:
Determine underlying factors for discrepancies in profitability. Examine areas like COGS, operating expenses, revenue generation, and asset utilization.
Implement Changes:
Use the insights gained from the analysis to make strategic adjustments to improve profitability.
Example Calculation:
For two hypothetical companies:

Company A:
Gross Profit Margin: 20%
Operating Profit Margin: 10%
Net Profit Margin: 5%
Margin per User: $10
Return on Assets: 10%
Company B:
Gross Profit Margin: 24%
Operating Profit Margin: 16%
Net Profit Margin: 8%
Margin per User: $16.67
Return on Assets: 13.3%
Analysis:
From this example, Company B generally shows superior profitability across all metrics. This might suggest better operational efficiency, cost management, or market positioning.

This condensed guide should provide all necessary information to effectively carry out and apply a profitability analysis based on company financials.

2. Liquidity analysis
Here’s a concise overview of liquidity ratios, their calculations, implications, and their importance for assessing a company's financial health:

Types of Liquidity Ratios and Calculations
Current Ratio
Formula: Current Assets / Current Liabilities
Explanation: Measures a company’s ability to cover its current liabilities with its current assets. It's the most basic liquidity test.
Quick Ratio
Formula: (Cash + Accounts Receivables + Marketable Securities) / Current Liabilities
Explanation: Provides a stricter liquidity measure by excluding less liquid current assets like inventory and prepaid expenses, focusing only on assets that can be quickly converted into cash.
Cash Ratio
Formula: (Cash + Marketable Securities) / Current Liabilities
Explanation: The most stringent liquidity test, considering only the most liquid assets. This ratio assesses the immediate solvency of a company.
Implications of Liquidity Ratios
Current Ratio: A higher ratio indicates a strong liquidity position, but industry norms can vary. Generally, a ratio above 1 is seen as healthy.
Quick Ratio: Lower than the current ratio due to its stricter asset inclusion, it's a more accurate measure of liquidity under urgent scenarios.
Cash Ratio: The lowest among the three, it reflects a company’s ability to pay off short-term liabilities immediately without selling any assets.
Importance of Liquidity Ratios
Ability to Cover Short-Term Obligations: Crucial for creditors and investors to determine if a company can meet its debts as they come due. Ratios below 1 suggest potential liquidity issues.
Creditworthiness Assessment: Creditors use these ratios to evaluate the risk of extending credit to a company.
Investment Decisions: Investors examine these ratios to gauge financial health and stability, ensuring the company can manage its short-term liabilities and has adequate working capital.
Considerations
An optimal liquidity ratio varies by industry and company conditions. While higher ratios typically suggest better liquidity, excessively high ratios might indicate inefficient use of assets, as they could be invested to generate higher returns.
Balancing liquidity and investment is key; too much liquidity may suggest underutilization of resources, whereas too little can risk solvency and operational effectiveness.


3. Solvency Analysis

Here’s a streamlined overview of solvency ratios, which are crucial for assessing a company's ability to meet its long-term debts:

Types of Solvency Ratios
Debt to Equity Ratio
Formula: Total Liabilities / Stockholders' Equity
Purpose: Measures financial leverage and the proportion of Stockholder equity to debt used to finance assets. A higher ratio indicates greater financial risk.
Debt Ratio
Formula: Total Liabilities / Total Assets
Purpose: Evaluates the percentage of a company's assets financed through debt. A higher ratio suggests more leverage and higher risk.
Equity Ratio (Proprietary Ratio)
Formula: Stockholders' Equity / Total Assets
Purpose: Indicates the proportion of assets funded by owners' equity, reflecting financial stability. A higher ratio demonstrates a stronger equity position.
Interest Coverage Ratio
Formula: EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) / Interest Expense
Purpose: Assesses the ability to cover interest expenses with operational earnings. Higher ratios indicate better solvency and lower financial stress.
This was all about the solvency ratios that determine the solvency of a business organisation by measuring its ability to pay long term debt obligations
Example of Solvency Ratio
Let us consider a company X which has closed the FY 2022-2023 with the below annual financial data –  

Net Income: Rs. 1,850 crores
Depreciation: Rs. 235.7 crores
Short-term debt: Rs. 991 crores
Long-term debt: Rs. 1,123.5 crores
Solvency Ratio = (Short-term Debt + Long-term Debt) / Equity

Given the financial data, first, we need to calculate the company’s equity. You can calculate equity using the below formula:

Equity = Net Income + Depreciation

Equity = Rs. 1,850 crores + Rs. 235.7 crores = Rs. 2,085.7 crores

Now, we can calculate the solvency ratio:

Solvency Ratio = (Short-term Debt + Long-term Debt) / Equity

Solvency Ratio = (Rs. 991 crores + Rs. 1,123.5 crores) / Rs. 2,085.7 crores

Solvency Ratio ≈ 1.05

In this example, the solvency ratio is approximately 1.05. This means that for every Rs. 1 of equity, the company has Rs. 1.05 of debt (both short-term and long-term combined). A solvency ratio above 1 indicates that the company has more debt than equity, which suggests a higher degree of financial risk.
